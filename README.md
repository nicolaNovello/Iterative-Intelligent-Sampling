# üíª How to run the code

The folder where the code is located must contain a folder `NetsImages` comprising the following folders: 
- `Datasets` containing the RSSI dataframe obtained after interpolation of the dataset in [https://github.com/beaugunderson/wifi-heatmap](https://github.com/beaugunderson/wifi-heatmap) and the initial training datasets randomly extracted from the same dataset
- `DRQN` containing the saved DRQN
- `FloorImages` containing the map layout
- `OptimalPaths` containing the images of the saved optimal paths traveled by the agent
- `RegModels` containing the saved PPNNs
- `scalers` containing the scaler used to standardize the dataset
- `accuraciesComparison` containing the saved test accuracies

The file `main.py` runs the experiments, while `main_functions.py`, `classes.py`, and `utils.py` comprise the classes and functions needed to run the main script.
